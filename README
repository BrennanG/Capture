Capture
-Made by Brennan Govreau in the fall 2014 semester at Saint Louis Universtiy for CSCI 293: Object-Oriented Software Design
-To run the game, open a terminal and go to the game's directory. Type "javac GameManager.java", then "java GameManager"
-How to Play:
	-Player 1 (white) moves its pieces using the keys W, A, S, and D. Player 2 (yellow) uses I, J, K and L.
	-Pieces move 1 square at a time.
	-Players decide where all of their pieces will move at the same time. Once both players have finished deciding, the pieces will be moved.
	-Each square of the board has a randomly generated color. The color represents the square's "wait time":
		Green Square		0 wait time
		Light Blue Square	1 wait time
		Dark Blue Square	2 wait time
		Purple Square		3 wait time
		Red Square			4 wait time
	-If a piece is on a square that has a wait time greater than 0, it will not move during its turn, but the wait time and color of the square will decrease by 1.
	-When a piece moves off of a square, the square will be randomly assigned a new color and wait time.
	-The objective of the game is to capture all of the opposing player's pieces.
	-To capture a piece, one of your pieces must land on the square that it is on.
	-When you capture a piece, the square that you captured it on will automatically be set to Green.
	-Players can capture their own pieces, which can be used strategically, because the square that it is captured on is set to Green.
	-If two pieces land on the same square on the same turn, both are captured.
